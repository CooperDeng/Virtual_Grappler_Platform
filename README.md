# Virtual_Grappler_Platform
This is a project that simulates a platform that enables moving the grappler to a certain coordinate and activate it.

This project contains several blocks including 2 registers, 2 binary counters, and 2 Compx4's. It also supports converting hexadecimal number to a 7-segment number, by including a number of 2 hex to 7-segment decoders. It also includes a reset features, where it is allowed to set eveerything to its normal state. 

The top-level of the design is Structural VHDL, while the instances of components used combinational and sequential logic. 

The generated state diagrams, transition tables, and waveforms for functional simulation could be found in file Virtual_Grappler_Platform_Report.pdf
