# Virtual_Grappler_Platform
This is a project that simulates a platform that enables moving the grappler to a certain coordinate and activate it.

This project contains several blocks including 2 registers, 2 binary counters, and 2 Compx4's. It also supports converting hexadecimal number to a 7-segment number, by including a number of 2 hex to 7-segment decoders. It also includes a reset features, where it is allowed to set eveerything to its normal state. 

The top-level of the design is Structural VHDL, while the instances of components used combinational and sequential logic. 

The generated state diagrams, transition tables, and waveforms for functional simulation could be found in file Virtual_Grappler_Platform_Report.pdf

The project were carried out and tested by the collaboration of Chengfeng Deng and Tasviq Hossain, with initial start-up files and instructions populated by the teaching team of ECE124 lab from class ECE 2026 of the University of Waterloo.

Files that are provided in this project are being used with no intention of profit, this is only an exhibit of my personal coding skill.

Enjoy!
